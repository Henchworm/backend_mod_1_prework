## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The part of the super learner article that most resonated with include teaching others, and taking breaks! I'm usually nervous to teach others about something unless I really know it, but I've found recently that trying to explain something or just simply saying it out loud can make you realize a detail you missed. I also have a bad habit of grinding with no breaks, so I have little pom reminders set to keep my brain feeling good.
