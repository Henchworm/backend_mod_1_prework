# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Chris Hewitt"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf
# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobby_quote = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts dobby_quote
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22

puts students + 2
# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
puts students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Chris"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 1
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.
# first_name: used to store my first name as a string,
# because we want to print my first name when asked.
#is_hungry: used a boolean, because you are either hungry or not.
#number_of_pets: used an integer, because you
#need a whole number to describe the number of pets.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Philip"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 100
puts "#{first_name} has #{number_of_pets} pets, and he is not hungry."
puts "This is #{is_hungry}! His real name is Chris, he has one pet and is hungry."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
#Yes
