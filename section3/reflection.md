## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
My favorite points are the following:
- "By believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice." I know this to be the case, with the little programming growth I've had so far, and especially from my time in the music field, where I spent countless hours practicing and honing my skills. I went from being an inexperienced high school percussionist to play some serious music convincingly in a few years. I know I can put that mindset towards programming, and relate my work ethic and perseverance to pushing through Turing!
-"By understanding that mistakes are essential to learning." I know that this is absolutely true. It's impossible to attempt something new and not make a ton of mistakes. I make mistakes with things I'm experienced in, mistakes a re a part of life. Through making mistakes you learn new pathways to find something, or stumble upon strategies that helps you avoid future mistakes and issues.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate a growth mindset by being keen to learn, not being afraid of mistakes, and I am prepared to reach out and ask for help when I need it. I need to work on my growth mindset by integrating SMART goals--I tend to take on a big chunk of work at a time, which can be discouraging.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A Hash is a collection of key and value pairs. It is different than an array in that it is organized by keys that the user chooses, rather than an integer index.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {
  'cats' => 5,
  'rats' => 4,
  'bats' => 2,
  'dogs' => 6,
 }
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
hash.[key] = value
states.[IA] = "Iowa "

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys, states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A hash could be used to catalog anything that has a useful associated value: for example, country telephone codes.
A hash is useful because you can search/pull/add information in the hash out of order, unlike an array that is indexed numerically.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Some of the hash syntax I find a little confusing, especially in the "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" example, but I felt comfortable in all the exercizes  and mod 0 practice we did with hashes.
